# RenderJS

RenderJS is a promised-based JavaScript library for developing modularized single page web applications. It uses HTML5 to specify self-contained components consisting of HTML5, CSS and Javascript (called "gadgets"). Gadgets are reusable in different applications just as easily as linking an HTML5 page to another and can combined to build complex applications.
